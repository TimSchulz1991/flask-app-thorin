    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
    came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
    decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
    also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
    superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
    business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.
